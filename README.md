# Clarkson University: Multimodal Longitudinal Infant-Toddler Biometric Dataset
Available to CITeR members only under the CITeR Database Release Agreement. 

Please contact citer@clarkson.edu and indicate the specific dataset.

Technical Contact: Stephanie Schuckers, sschucke@clarkson.edu 

Data were collected from six different modalities at an approximate time interval of 15 days to 3 months, longitudinally over 2 years. Collected at the Canton Pediatric Office and Clarkson University. Funded by the CITeR and National Science Foundation. This biometric dataset collection contains data of six biometric modalities. Few modalities are collected using more than one sensor:
- Fingerprints
- Footprints
- Face
- Ear
- NIR Iris
- Palm

Collection Summary:

**Time Span:** 2 years

**Sessions:** 6 sessions 

**Participation Count:** 30

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Not all subjects participated in all collections. The variation in the number of participants for each collection is impacted by newly enrolled participants, absentees, those unwilling to participate on a given day, and participants whose families have moved out of the Canton–Potsdam area.*

**Age Span of participants:** 0 to 3 years at enrollment
